    basketball players of all time, and is frequently at the center of debates regarding the sport's all-time best, often
    being compared to Michael Jordan.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made
    eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018. He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers,
